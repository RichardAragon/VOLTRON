# VOLTRON: Very Obvious Language TRanslator, Obviating Need for SQL expertise
A fusion of Neural Networks and Rules Based functions for database retrieval and API functions

Natural Language to SQL Translator

 This project provides a basic framework for translating natural language queries into SQL statements. It utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for intent analysis and keyword extraction and leverages NER and dependency parsing to enhance the generation of SQL conditions.

 Setup
 
tiny_llama (Replace with your actual LLM library)
spaCy (https://spacy.io)

 Code Explanation

 Core Functions:

analyze_query(): Uses an LLM to determine the intent of a user's query and extracts relevant keywords.
map_keywords_to_sql(): Creates a simple mapping between keywords and database elements.
extract_conditions_enhanced(): Extracts conditions from the query (can be significantly improved).
build_query(): Constructs the SQL query using provided templates.
 Placeholder Functions:

load_ner_model(): Replace with your spaCy model loading code.
load_dependency_parser(): Replace with your spaCy model loading code.

 Potential Improvements

Condition Extraction: Integrate dependency parsing and LLM capabilities to generate more complex and accurate SQL conditions.
Keyword Mapping Expansion: Include more keywords and database mappings to increase system versatility.
More Query Templates: Support a wider variety of user query intents.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling.

 Disclaimer

 This project serves as a starting point for natural language to SQL development. Current functionality is basic, and ongoing improvement is expected.
